# MEE-IMBCR-BBS-eBird-data-integration
This repository contains the code and data used in the paper entitled "Integrating counts from rigorous surveys and participatory science to better understand spatiotemporal variation in population processes" publised in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

Code: Code for the simulations start with the word "simulation" in its file name. The file names also contain information (e.g., model name) that is consistent with the description of the simulations in the text and Figures 1-3. Code for the case study start with the words "case study" in its file name. The file names also indicate the model (IMBCR only, IMBCR + BBS, IMBCR + BBS + eBird, BBS + eBird) and if the analysis is conducted for the entire study area and time period (all) or limited to the same area and time period as IMBCR (limited).

Data: Baird's Sparrow count data from IMBCR, BBS, and eBird are provided. Covariates (grassland coverage and temperature) data are also provided. A separate file to indicating which Bird Conservation Region (BCR) each 5km grid cell belongs to is also provided.
